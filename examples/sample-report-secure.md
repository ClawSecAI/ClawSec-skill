## Detailed Findings

### 🟢 LOW - Default Port Usage

**Threat ID**: T008
**Description**: Using default OpenClaw port makes system easier to discover
**Impact**: Easier reconnaissance for attackers
**Likelihood**: LOW

**Evidence**:
```json
{
  "port": 2024
}
```

**Remediation Steps**:

**Short term**:
- [ ] Change to non-standard port (e.g., 8443)

**Long term**:
- [ ] Use reverse proxy with standard HTTPS port

---

## Security Best Practices Observed

✅ **Strong Gateway Token**: 64-character random token  
✅ **Localhost Binding**: Gateway not exposed to public internet  
✅ **Session Encryption**: Enabled with strong encryption key  
✅ **Tool Restrictions**: Exec policy set to allowlist with specific commands  
✅ **Secrets Management**: API keys stored in environment variables  
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Configured with appropriate limits

## Recommendations for Further Hardening

While your configuration is secure, consider these additional improvements:

### Defense in Depth

1. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up log aggregation (Papertrail, Loggly)
   - Configure health check monitoring (UptimeRobot)
   - Track failed authentication attempts

2. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Regular configuration backups
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Test backup restoration

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Schedule monthly security scans
   - Review and update threat intelligence
   - Audit user access and permissions

4. **Advanced Security**
   - Consider implementing 2FA for sensitive operations
   - Use hardware security keys for critical credentials
   - Implement network segmentation

## Next Steps

### This Week
1. Consider changing gateway port to non-standard value
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Schedule regular security scans

### This Month
1. Implement advanced hardening measures
2. Document security procedures
3. Conduct penetration testing
4. Train team on security best practices

## About This Configuration

Your OpenClaw deployment demonstrates excellent security practices:

- **Strong Authentication**: Random, high-entropy tokens
- **Network Security**: Localhost-only binding prevents external attacks
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted session storage protects privacy
- **Access Control**: Tool policies prevent unauthorized command execution
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables keep credentials secure

**Keep up the good work!** 🎉👁️

Continue monitoring for new threats and apply security updates promptly. Regular audits help maintain this strong security posture.
